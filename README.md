[**OrbStack**](https://orbstack.dev) is a fast, light, and simple way to run Docker containers and Linux machines on macOS. Say goodbye to slow, clunky containers and VMs.

## Features

- ⚡️ **Fast.** Starts in under 2 seconds, optimized networking (30 Gbps!) and disk, Rosetta x86 emulation on Apple Silicon.
- 💨 **Light.** Low CPU and disk usage, works with less memory, native Swift app.
- 🍰 **Simple.** Minimal setup, seamless Docker, 2-way CLI integration, file access from Mac and Linux, works with VPNs and remote VS Code, SSH agent forwarding.
- ⚙️ **Powerful.** Run Docker containers, full Linux distros, and Kubernetes (coming soon). No admin/root required. Network works with IPv6, ICMP, traceroute — you name it.
